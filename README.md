# kifu-recorder-tests
This is a repository where tests for features that will be integrated in Kifu Recorder are organized and stored

## Board corner tracking
This feature allows the camera to move while recording a game and still keep track of the game board correctly.

A first test was made in Python + OpenCV because I didn't want to compile the library just to use it. The second test (with Java) was done after I managed to compile the library.
