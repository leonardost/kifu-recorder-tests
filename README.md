# kifu-recorder-tests
This is a repository where tests for features that will be integrated in Kifu
Recorder are organized and stored.

## Board corner tracking
This feature allows the camera to move while recording a game and still keep
track of the game board correctly.

A first test was done in Python + OpenCV because I didn't want to compile the
library just to use it. The second test (with Java) was done after I managed
to compile the library.

## Datasets
The sets of images used for the tests are freely available and can be accesed
